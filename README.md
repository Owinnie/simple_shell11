# 0x16. C - Simple Shell ==> OwShell

## UNIX Command Line Intepreter
- Displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command --> $
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- Handles basic commands eg, pwd, ls, cd, exit...
- Displays err messages in case of err



### HOW TO START OwShell
1. First compile:

      ## gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

2. Run: ./hsh

      ## Owinnie@root $

      ----> It's ready for your input; start typing. Don't get too excited albeit. Some advanced
            shell commands might not work. Experiment and make them work...

3. Had enough fun? Exit:

      ## Owinnie@root $ exit
